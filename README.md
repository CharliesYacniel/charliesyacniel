### Hi I'm Charlies Yacniel 👋


👨🏽‍💻 I am a programmer with ➕ 4 years of experience in the software development life cycle, I specialize in the backend of applications created under the best development practices, design patterns 🎨 and data security ✅. In the frontend I am dedicated to the implementation of UI / UX of different client platforms that belong to the areas of:
🏛 Banking and Finance
📲 Mobile
⛽️ Oil.
This experience has been gained by implementing client-server applications ☁️, API 🔩, designing databases 📚 and implementing interfaces with third parties.
Currently, I put together the Rubik's cube and study mathematics at UNAH 🧮.
